Basic idea (move units around, units look the same to the enemy but have distinct traits) can be worked out in many ways.

Guiding principals:
* Prefer asymmetric information to randomness when possible
* Game should be half an hour or less typically in duration
* Games should not "drag on", if a player has a clear advantage a win should happen in just one or two turns

Possible Win Conditions:
* Total annihilation (e.g. checkers)
  - very likely to violate the "drag on" principal
* Regicide: Each team has one "king" or "flag" unit, destroying that unit is a win (e.g. chess)
  - fun thing about stratego was 1. fooling the other player about where the flag was, 2. finding the flag when you were losing to pull out a win
* Crossing the board, or reaching a special position (the enemy's gate is down?)

Probably I prefer Regicide...

Units:

lots of ideas here....

RockPaperScissors-type mechanics are fun.

Do units have separate attack and defense?

stratego just has one "rank" and the higher rank wins, but there was a "spy" who could defeat the strongest piece only if it was attacking

my neighbor had "electric stratego", which did not reveal the pieces at all in a battle. Instead it just would signal win/lose/tie. Interesting idea for preserving mystery...

possibilities for "powers" are essentially infinite.

Could be fun to pick a "theme". Classic fantasy seems like a good one. With "magic" you can make any mechanic possible

Units could have "abilities" and "weapons". "weapons" could be taken when the unit is captured?
