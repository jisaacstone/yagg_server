  <p>YAGG is a turn-based strategy game.
  <section id="phases">
    <h2>Phases</h2>
    <p>A game of YAGG has 2-3 phases, depending on the game type.
    <h3>Recruitment</h3>
    <p>Some game types begin with a recruitment phase.
    Both players select desired units and then press "RECRUIT".
    <h3>Placement</h3>
    <p>Select the starting position of your units.
    The only unit you must place is your Monarch or Flag,
    All other units may be left in your hand to be placed later.
    After placing your units press "READY" to start battle.
    <h3>Battle</h3>
    <p>On your turn you must do one of the following
      <h4>Move</h4>
      <p>Units move one square at a time.
      Units cannot move diagonally. Some units are immobile.
      They can neither move nor attack.
      <h4>Attack</h4>
      <p>Moving your unit into a square that has an enemy unit is an attack.
      If the attacker's Attack is greater than the opponent's Defense
      the opponent is destroyed and the attacker will move into the defender's square. Otherwise the attacker is destroyed.
      <h4>Place</h4>
      <p>Units can be placed in the battle phase the same as the placement phase.
      <h4>Ability</h4>
      <p>Some units have special abilities. Using any ability will end your turn

  <section id="triggers">
    <h2>Triggers</h2>
    <p>Some units have abilities that trigger under certain conditions
    <h3>Move</h3>
    <p>A move trigger will activate after a unit moves.
    If a unit loses a battle it's move trigger will not activate.
    <h3>Attack</h3>
    <p>Attack triggers activate before a unit attacks.
    Attack triggers may change how a unit does battle, or prevent battle from happening entirely.
    <h3>Death</h3>
    <p>Death triggers happen immediately after a unit dies.
    In a battle if the opponent dies, the death trigger will happen before the attacker's move trigger.
  </section>
  <a class="top" href="#top">top</a>
  <section id="board-features">
    <h2>Board</h2>
    <p>The board size varies from 5x5 up to 8x8.
    Boards also have water or block squares that affect gameplay
    <h3>Water</h3>
    <img src="img/howto/water.png" class="feature"/>
    <p>Units cannot cross water, but some special abilities can cross over the top of water, such as Maycorn's spark or Howloo's horseshoe.
    <p>Water squares can only be moved by Busybody's special ability.
    <h3>Block</h3>
    <img src="img/howto/block.png" class="feature"/>
    <p>A block can be pushed by a unit if the square on the other side is empty. Otherwise a block will block movement.
    Blocks are moved by special abilities the same as units.
    <p>If you are trying to push a block but it will not move, there is likely an invisible unit on the other side.
